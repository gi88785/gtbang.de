I want to build a dynamic personal Webpage.
i have bought a domain on Godaddy.
i have added it somehow to infinityfree.
i have built a simple index.html to display that my webpage is currently being built.
I have downloaded and installed node.
i have verified everything has been installed.
I created a projekt folder name "Project_folder" where i placed my index.html.
I moved to "Project_folder" on powershell an ran "npm init -y".  
I ran npm install http --save.
then i created a server.js.
I ran "node server.js" in powershell everything worked, the message was diplayed.


------


I created a database for my web page in infinity free
Now i created a new server.js to upload in the file manager of my infinity free account.
I think my database is also connecteded to the web page. i included the codes for this in my server.js file.
i entered the url for my page online and it worked.
I added a free SSl certificate from zerossl.
I downloaded the certificate, i extracted it and added it to my folder. then i modified both server.js and pointed the key and cert variables to my certificates.
i then uploaded it to infinity and my website funnily works with a https now.

I will use React and express
I have installed locally using "npm install -g create-react-app"
I ran "npm install tar@latest" to update the tar dependency since it is outdated and had vulnerabilities
I created a new React project in a folder named "myapp" using the command "create-react-app myapp"
I moved the contents of the "myapp" folder in "Project_folder"
Using "npm install express react react-dom react-router-dom" i installed the required dependencies for React and Express

-------
Create a new file named "app.js" and add your Express server code there. Make sure to add a route that serves the React app, such as:
csharp
Copy code
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));
});
Start your server by running the command node app.js.
In your React app, you can start making changes and adding your personal information on the "index.js" and "App.js" files. You can also create new components and pages as needed.
Once you are done making changes, build your React app by running the command npm run build. This will create a production-ready build of your React app in a "build" folder.
Upload the contents of the "build" folder to your server, and your React app should be live!
Keep in mind that this is a general overview, and there may be additional steps or configurations required depending on your specific project requirements. Also, it's a good idea to follow best practices for structuring your project, such as separating your server-side code and client-side code into separate folders.

I just changed the hosting provider i a,m supposed to use. Since i was having problems while using Infinity Free. 

Seems as if there was a setting in go daddy to enable or disable the ,modification of DNS settings.
