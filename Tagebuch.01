I want to build a dynamic Webpage.
i have bought a domain on Godaddy.
i have added it somehow to infinityfree.
i have built a simple index.html to display that my webpage is currently being built.
I have downloaded and installed node.
i have verified everything has been installed.
I created a projekt folder name "Project_folder" where i placed my index.html.
I moved to "Project_folder" on powershell an ran "npm init -y".  
I ran npm install http --save.
I then created 'server.js'.
I ran "node server.js" in powershell everything worked, the message was diplayed.

------

I created a database for my web page in infinity free
Now i created a new server.js to upload in the file manager of my infinity free account.
I think my database is also connecteded to the web page. i included the codes for this in my server.js file.
I entered the url for my page online and it worked.
I inquired a free SSl certificate from zerossl.
I downloaded the certificate, extracted it and added it to my folder. 
I modified both server.js and pointed the key and cert variables to my certificates.
I then uploaded it to infinity and my website funnily works with a https now.

I will use React and express
I have installed React locally using "npm install -g create-react-app"
I ran "npm install tar@latest" to update the tar dependency since it is outdated and had vulnerabilities
I created a new React project in a folder named "myapp" using the command "create-react-app myapp"
I moved the contents of the "myapp" folder in "Project_folder"
Using "npm install express react react-dom react-router-dom" i installed the required dependencies for React and Express
...
-------

The first(index) page will be having informations about me.

I just changed the hosting provider Since i was having problems while using Infinity Free or perhaps there is a bug in godaddy since i can't modify the DNS settings of my Domain.!
