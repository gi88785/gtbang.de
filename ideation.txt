1. I have only used HTML and CSS for this Project
2. I have used Bootstrap5 as CSS library.

Problems & Justifications :

1. It is quite easy to use HTML and Css and I did not see the need to use js, since I ain't doing anything wild.
2. I did not use jquery beacause it is obsolate and i was only getting issues in my git repo beacuse of it.
3. For the icons I have downloaded them from the internet here and there.
4. I still have a lot of difficulties to have the page show exactly the way i want; i would for example like :
- to have one big background image
- fix all the color issues
- make scroller on the footer scroll infinitely
- usw.
